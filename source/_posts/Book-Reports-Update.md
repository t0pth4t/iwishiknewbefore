## Algorithms to Live By

- Optimal stopping 37% also known as the secretary problem. If you don't have full knowledge of what the "best" is. If you do have full knowledge you stop immediately as soon as you get something that exceeds your requirements.
- Explore while you have time to use the resulting knowledge. Exploit when you're ready to cash in. Finding a new restaurant the day before you leave vs when you just arrived.
- Multi armed bandit problem
- Optimism best way to minimize regret
- Sort vs search time trade off in real life. Takes much more time to sort with slow hands than to search with quick eyes. Plus how often do you access something like a book shelf such that you need it sorted.
- Ordering things in real life as it applies to sports. 1st loss elimination only picks the #1 team or person. The others are not accurately chosen due to the nature of losing to one team completely eliminating you. The losers should play each other to determine 2nd and 3rd etc...
- Money is a non ambiguous sorter
- Way of thinking about cognitive decline. More things stored in memory means slower retrieval. Older you are the more you have in storage. Off load as much meaningless information for faster retrieval
- 3 prediction rules. Multiplicative, the longer something goes on the longer you can expect it to go on additive and average. 
- Laplace's law. Guesses with little information
- If you want to guess how long something will last or how likely it is but have no prior information you use the Corpincan principle. Say it will go as long as it has already. There's been life on Earth for 3.5 billion years so you would expect it to be on Earth for another 3.5 billion. Predict how many tanks by doubling the serial number.
- Normal distribution like age bell curve. Average rule. Use the natural scale as the predictor. If someone is younger than the average life span just predict the average. If the get close or exceed the average. Predict they'll live a few years more. Events are surprising when they're early but not when they're late or past the average. Overdue to happen. Like dying at an older than average she rather than younger than average
- Power law distribution. size of towns 10,1000,millions of people or income. Multiplicative rule because there's no natural scale. The larger the initial value the larger the multiplier. The longer something has gone on the longer we expect it to continue to go on
- Invariant events erlang distribution. Always predict things will go on just a constant amount longer. Memory-less things like winning at a slot machine. Never more or less surprising regardless of how long
- Communication moved from circuit switched to packet switched. Instead of missing a call you now have a back log of emails
- You can't beat the equilibrium of a game without an externality. The equilibrium for the prisoners dilemma is to always defect. But if there was a mob boss who would kill you for defecting the equilibrium has changed. Same goes for giving people unlimited vacation. People always take less than their peers as to appear harder working. You can only change this by forcing them to take vacation. Offering money to take vacation doesn't work. It's an argument against purely rational decision making. The best outcome on the prisoners dilemma is to both not defect but it's not the rational decision
- Ultimate goal is to reduce computation. You can do this for others by constraining options. Can we setup a meeting whenever you're free versus can we setup a meeting between 1 and 2 on Thursday. Same goes for choosing what to do or where to eat. 

## Breakfast of Champions

- Another fantastic Vonnegut book. Listened to the audiobook narrated by John Malkovich which made it even better. 
- There was something in there about the world being the way it is because it has to be. That piece of trash sitting there will always be there. Very fatalist

## Brave New World

- Got very little out of this book. Felt simplistic 

## The Tao of Pooh

- The best book on the Tao in my opinion. Got much more from reading this than reading multiple translations of the Tao Te Ching
- The Tao is the way. Live like Pooh

## The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat

- Remember very little from this but Oliver Sacks is an interesting read

## Great Minds of the Eastern Intellectual Tradition

- Opened my mind to a world of Eastern philosophy completely ignored by western education. 
- the vinegar tasters
    - Buddhism
        - Buddhism is about escaping our horrible existence by reaching enlightenment. Buddhists also believe in a heaven and hell but the Bhudda is not a God. Also bhudism originally started in India and Zen bhudism is just one form. The sutras and religious texts diamond sutra and heart sutra
    - Taoism
        - Taosim is about letting things flow naturally and not trying to hard. A cork in the water or the old man in the waterfall.
    - Confucianism
    - Hinduism is the most practiced religion in India. They believe in reincarnation called Samsara. Which is why many Hindus are vegetarian. Cows are sacred. The Bhagavad Gita, the Vedas and the upanishads are sacred texts.

## The Science of Information: From Language to Black Holes

## The New Jim Crow

- Interesting points made in this book but suffers from being very dry with no humanity injected like Eviction
- Slavery is legal in the constitution for criminals
- 3 strikes laws put a man in prison for life for stealing a VHS tape

## The Te of Piglet

- Not nearly as popular as the Tao of Pooh for good reason. The author interjects some outdated and somewhat misogynist points of view in this narrative. 

## Superforcasting

- Some things are nearly impossible to predict even if you know how the process works like how clouds form because there are so many variables
- Predictions are meaningless without validation
- System 1 thinking leads to poor predictions in many scenarios like the stock market or medicine.

## Redefining Reality

## In Cold Blood

- This is a classic for a reason. Very interesting story. Worth the read. The movie not so much.

## Being Mortal

- Something worth revisiting as I get older or when parents get older but not much practical advise for me now.
- Dying with dignity and comfortably is so much more important than saving someones life but destroying their quality of life at the end. 

## Your Deceptive Mind: A Scientific Guide tp Critical Thinking Skills

## Great Minds of Western Intellectual Tradition

- Started with the sophists presocratic thinkers became reviled because Socrates believed them immoral
- Rhetoric the art of persuasion
- Plato's metaphysics is on the study of what's real in our minds eye. When a teacher draws a triangle on a chalkboard and says I'm going to teach you the Pythagorean theorem the chalk triangle is not a real perfect triangle but it is in your mind. You will never interact with perfect forms of things in reality but they exist in your minds eye. Everything is a shadow of reality
- Socratic method is question and answer dialog
- Sophists were the first "paid" teachers people just used to learn from their parents. Also they taught rhetoric because it was everything back then. You're ability to express your ideas vocally to people was the only way to spread ideology because there was no real mass media
- Sophists believed all values were relative
- Socrates believed justice was about allowing people to reach their full potential. Their aret√©
- Most non-esoteric western philosophy is probably too deeply baked into my culture for me to feel like I got something interesting out of this

## Bad Blood

- Like "In Cold Blood" for Silicon Valley. I thought I knew enough about this story to make the book uninteresting but I couldn't stop listening to it.

## In Watermelon Sugar

## Trout Fishing in America

## Revenge Of The Lawn

## The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966

## So The Wind Won't Blow It All Away

## Tao Te Ching (Ursula K. Le Guin)

## Tao Te Ching (Derek Lin)

## Tao Te Ching (Stephen Mitchell)
