- Don't let the candidate do most of the talking. You should do most of the talking.
- Look for specific answers and drive the candidate along until you get the answer you're looking for or realize they do not know the answer
- Candidates who have programmed mostly in a single language (e.g. C/C++), platform (e.g. AIX) or framework (e.g. J2EE) usually have major, gaping holes in their skills lineup. These candidates will fail their interviews here because our interviews cover a broad range of skill areas. 
- Five essential questions for the first phone-screen
    1. Coding - The candidate has to write some simple code, with correct syntax, in C, C++, or Java.
    2. OO design - The candidate has to define basic OO concepts, and come up with classes to model a simple problem.
    3. Scripting and regexes - The candidate has to describe how to find the phone numbers in 50,000 HTML pages.
    4. Data structures - The candidate has to demonstrate basic knowledge of the most common data structures.
    5. Bits and bytes - The candidate has to answer simple questions about bits, bytes, and binary numbers.
