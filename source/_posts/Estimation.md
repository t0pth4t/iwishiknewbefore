- Over-confidence in estimation
  - The uncertainty of a software development effort estimate can be indicated through a prediction interval (PI), i.e., the estimated minimum and maximum effort corresponding to a specific confidence level. For example, a project manager may be “90% confident” or believe that is it “very likely” that the effort required to complete a project will be between 8000 and 12,000 work-hours. This paper describes results from four studies (Studies A–D) on human judgement (expert) based PIs of software development effort. Study A examines the accuracy of the PIs in real software projects. The results suggest that the PIs were generally much too narrow to reflect the chosen level of confidence, i.e., that there was a strong over-confidence. Studies B–D try to understand the reasons for the observed over-confidence. Study B examines the possibility that the over-confidence is related to type of experience or estimation process. Study C examines the possibility that the concept of confidence level is difficult to interpret for software estimators. Finally, Study D examines the possibility that there are unfortunate feedback mechanisms that reward over-confidence.
- Small Matter of Programming
  - A piece of code, not yet written, whose anticipated length is significantly greater than its complexity. Used to refer to a program that could obviously be written, but is not worth the trouble. Also used ironically to imply that a difficult problem can be easily solved because a program can be written to do it; the irony is that it is very clear that writing such a program will be a great deal of work. “It's easy to enhance a FORTRAN compiler to compile COBOL as well; it's just a SMOP.”
  - Often used ironically by the intended victim when a suggestion for a program is made which seems easy to the suggester, but is obviously (to the victim) a lot of work. Compare minor detail.
- Ninety-ninety rule
  - The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time
