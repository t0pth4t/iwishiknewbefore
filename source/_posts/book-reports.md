# The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined
- Violence has declined despite common perception
- We were a lot worse to animals than you think

# Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow
- Remember very little but may be the book that taught me that IQ scores have steadily risen over time to the point that the average IQ score from some high number of years ago, lets say 100, would have been a learning disabled IQ score today

# Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis
- Reinforcing the idea that "Hillbilly" culture is an honor culture
- You can pull yourself up by your bootstraps and go to Yale Law School after being raised in abject poverty

# Between the World and Me
- Remember very little but a short and interesting book nonetheless
- On re-listen interesting point about how the white race only became the white race when it became convenient to lump Italians, Jews, Irish, Polish, etc.. into one category against another, black.
- Lots of mention of the black body and the power others try to exert over it

# Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder
- Being anti-fragile means being able to respond to failure
- Fragile organizations/systems are ones that have never experienced failure and will be taken down when a failure occurs

# On Intelligence
- Interesting insight into how the brain can react to things like catching a baseball thats traveling at some high MPH even though neurons relatively slowly. Idea is that the brain does rapid pattern matching

# Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike
- Phil Knight was incredibly lucky in several ways 
    - having a extremely famous olympic running coach as his highschool running coach who he could then turn to to be a 50/50 partner in his shoe business
    - getting a large loan from his father
    - Going on a whim to a shoe manufacturer in Japan that just happen to produce fantastic shoes
    - Having an early employee who was insane about selling the product
- But the main takeaway is he was not the only one on his track team but he was the only one who started Nike. Seeing your luck and seizing the opportunity is the key

# Mastery
- Mostly a lot of name dropping famous 'masters' and how they worked hard to get where they were

# Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies
- Dry extremely boring science fiction about the potential dangers of AI

# A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy
- Some keys to Stoicism 
    - Negative visualization (imaging losing a job or loved one) helps you appreciate what you have
    - Not stressing about things that you do not control
- on insults if it is from someone you respect you should take it to heart. If its from someone you dislike you should take the insult as confirmation that you are doing something right since someone you don't respect doesn't approve of what you are doing. Also you can use self-deprecating humor to defend yourself. Otherwise just don't respond to insults unless you are in power
- don't let wealth and fame be your master. Wealth and fame are to be enjoyed in a virtuous manner but not pursued 
- Don't fear death because it is the strongest form of negative visualization. Some stoics approved of suicide if you were no longer to live a good life.
- Stocism declined in popularity likely due to Christianity and modern psychology telling us to deal with our problems in an open and expressive manner

# 48 Laws of Power
- Manipulative techniques on how to get 'Power' that I do not remember a single one

# No Excuses: Existentialism and the Meaning of Life
- Way above my head. Got nothing from this

# The Denial of Death
- Remember nothing from this
- On re-listen
    - book is very dense and so far offers nothing of interest. Focus on what sounds to me like ancient views on psychology in the vein of Freud. Spends a significant amount of time talking about childhood "anality" for example.

# FREE: The Future of a Radical Price
- How free products can become  successes

# Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst
- Very interesting but dense book worth another listen
- Convinced me that free will is an illusion. Although if it looks like free will and quacks like free will its free will to me
- Leaned me towards believe that the 'justice' system is deeply flawed because we do not have control of our actions.
- Reinforced the idea that how you were raised strongly determines your future

# Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think
- I remember nothing besides it was a positive book

# Smoke Gets in Your Eyes: And Other Lessons from the Crematory
- Super fun listen not many interesting insights

# Scientific Secrets for Raising Kids Who Thrive
- Great lectures listened to several times compiled a list of notes separately

# The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable
- Point is in the title. Be prepared for rare events (black swans)

# Nonviolent Communication: Create Your Life, Your Relationships, and Your World in Harmony with Your Values
- Probably worth another read though the author is the narrator and he is very hard to listen to

# Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World
- It is important to get into flow states and free yourself from distractions

# Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion
- Not much meat to this one. Brings up the Milgram study, Kitty Genovese
- One thing I didn't think was true but is, is that people commit suicide at higher rates after a highly publicized suicide

# Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything
- Pretty interesting book on the craft on mnemonics or the art of memorization
- Its all about memory palaces and picturing dirty things
- Also interesting that there were several memory champs who drank large amounts of alcohol

# Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City
- Extremely interesting slice of life about how hard it is to break free from the cycle of evictions. Written about Milwaukee

# Your Best Brain: The Science of Brain Improvement
- Pretty good overview of the parts of the brain and there function but presented in a very academic manner which made it less interesting 

# Critical Business Skills for Success
- Some parts were very interesting and worth a re-listen while taking notes. Others like the parts about finance were dry and not very useful

# You Are Now Less Dumb: How to Conquer Mob Mentality, How to Buy Happiness, and All the Other Ways to Outsmart Yourself
- Remember very little but short enough for a re-listen with proper note taking

# Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me) : Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions and Hurtful Acts
- Pretty entertaining book with several stories about how we justify/get out of mistakes we make
- Story about the devil worshipping scare in the daycares was interesting
- Probably not from this book but there was an interesting mistake we make where we think something is more likely if its associated with another event like its more likely that Mary donated to Peta and drives a Prius than Mary donated to Peta

# Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind
- Interesting book about history but can't remember much

# So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love
- Don't remember specifics but really made me want to do something

# Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams
- Good book although can be very long winded at parts. Largest point is not getting sleep is very very very bad for you.
- Not sleeping as much as we get older is not the natural way of things and probably contributes to the numerous brain disorders as we age.
- Drinking alcohol is massively bad for sleep so if you are going to get drunk do it in the middle of the day
- Caffeine has a really long half life and can wake you up in the middle of the night
- Melatonin is only good for jet lag

# Consider the Lobster and Other Essays (Selected Essays)
- Makes me more confident in my decision to be veg
- Very interesting listen overall as its narrated by David Foster Wallace. 

# Outliers: The Story of Success
- I don't remember anything from this book

# Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance
- Very dense book that felt really profound but I couldn't focus enough on it while listening to it so I bought the paper copy

# Slaughterhouse-Five
- Great book. Time is out of order and we never die that is just us in that moment. Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt

# Strangers to Ourselves: Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious
- Remember very little from this book. Aside from the fact that we develop theory of mind when we are toddlers. And we can be highly influenced by things we are not consciously aware of such as smelly garbage in a room. Or someone using a power tool while we are watching a video about power tools.
- Also we are influenced by the order of things

# Fahrenheit 451
- Pretty entertaining and short. We keep the books in our heads and we become victims to constant entertainment and distraction

# Brain Myths Exploded: Lessons from Neuroscience
- Actually a lot of information I had not heard in this and some pretty interesting insights. Worth looking at the PDF on Audible

# Quiet 
- Interesting point about how the desire for extroversion is a modern invention. 
- Book was mostly focused on the "good" traits that introverts posses and how it makes introverts equal or better than extroverts in certain areas. Left me thinking ..no duh.. throughout.
