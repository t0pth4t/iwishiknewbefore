1. You won’t sleep. Even if your baby is a “sleeper” you still won’t sleep; how can you? The media, doctors and everyone in between will worry you so much you’ll never sleep soundly again. The only real sleep you’ll get is when you go away, without your kids, all by yourself in a hotel room, or a padded room.

2. Little bitty babies – think of them as little bitty humans – some days you’re cold, some days you’re hot, some days you’re cranky, some days you’re not, some days you’re not hungry, some days you can eat an entire cake – in one bite. Babies have their moods too! It’s one of the most challenging “things” to grasp and can be rough if you’re a Type A-person and want things a certain way but try to go with the flow, it will help a lot – trust me. TRY!

3. Choose two or three close family or friends that you can bounce your questions off of, if you ask too many people you’ll end up in that padded room.

4. Mommy brain. You won’t remember a thing, don’t worry it happens to all of us.

5. TRUST yourself. Please trust yourself. PLEASE.

6. You will make mistakes and it’s okay.

7. Don’t compare your child to anyone, even a sibling. If Johnny walks at 8 months, and Samantha at 12 months, so be it, it happens.

8. There is an END in sight with every stage of child rearing. From the early months of sleep deprivation to the terrible two’s to the potty training to the biting to the everything, even the puberty, the teenage angst – you’ll get through it, be patient.

9. Trust your instincts, it may take a little fine tuning but you do have natural maternal instincts, yes, I’m still finding mine but they are there.

10. When someone is watching your child, ok when your mom or mother-in-law is watching your child, don’t be a control freak. Let them care for their grandchild the way they want and the way they know how. They’ve raised you, and your spouse…didn’t they?

11. You are not strange or alone when you feel that a trip to Target is liberating. It is.

12. Bottle fed, breast fed, cereal, fruits, vegetables and whatever else, feeding your child is a chore. The only joy you’ll get when you feed your child is in the early months – breast or bottle fed – except maybe at 2 am, sleep deprived, your husband is sleeping in your cozy bed and you want to drive a hammer to his head because well, he’s sleeping. But yes, the early stages are wonderful, anything past six months is horrible and not at all enjoyable.

13. Listen to your children – all ages, listening is hard but do it, you’ll learn so much.

14. You will become a human napkin. Invest in spot cleaner.

15. They grow up quickly.  It’s cliche I realize but it’s true, stop to ENJOY your children.

16. The laundry never ends. Much like the mail, it never stops, it never will, the laundry room will be your best friend.

17. You will feel everything your child is going through and then some. The amazing, the good, the bad, and the ugly. The amazing is well amazing, the good is great, the bad and ugly hurt so much you’ll feel like you can’t breathe and that your heart will stop. So painful. Imagine being a grandparent? Holy moly! This has to be 100x worse.

18. Be kind to yourself, take care of yourself, take time for yourself – an hour a week – if it’s a walk, reading a book, taking a class, mani/pedi do something, you have to decompress or you won’t be able to take care of anyone.

19. Let your children be themselves. A psychologist told me that our children are exaggerated versions of ourselves, I get that but they do have their own personality, quirks, and interests as well. If Johnny doesn’t like tennis as much as mommy, well so be it.

20. Your children define unconditional love. Yes, you love your husband, partner, parents, siblings, friends, relatives but there is nothing like the love you have for your child. It’s overwhelming, unexplainable, real, and exhausting.

1. Interviewing providers, and hand picking a hospital, or birth facility that would be best for your is most important. You cannot blindly pick a hospital, or where ever your insurance gives you the green light to birth at. For most women there are more options, and interviewing providers will really eliminate any kind of conflicts you may have in late pregnancy, or even during delivery.  It isn’t going to guarantee you a perfect birth, but knowing you put more thought than just asking your sister, or best girlfriend who she goes to will be a huge help.

2. Watch The Business of Being Born. I wish I had seen it before I had my first child, and not in the months afterward.  I think that is what helped me to know that what happened during my son’s birth didn’t need to, and it helped me to help other woman avoid everything that I went through.



3. Take a childbirth education class!  We see so many women, and couples in general skipping these classes, or opting for condensed one day speed courses, and then by the time the baby comes, most is forgotten, and all they learned goes out the window. Then they say well I wish I knew this, or that… but if they had really taken the time to become educated, and take a class that wasn’t going to interfere with the golf course, or girls night out, they may be in a better place…  Heck, if my pediatrician who is expecting her first child can swing  a full childbirth education course almost 12 weeks long, anyone can!

4. Read! – Skip the books that are going to scare you or try and make fun of pregnancy. What to expect while expecting scared the crap out of me, and if I had a penny for every woman who said the same thing to me, I would be a millionaire.

5. Breastfeeding is not a walk in the park, and your pediatrician may be absolutely no help. In fact many know very little about breastfeeding in general, and give out horrid breastfeeding advice. I went through that with my oldest son because they were constantly concerned about his weight gain. Never once was I told that the weight gain charts are actually based off of formula fed babies, which clearly makes a huge difference.

6. Your children will not be perfect no matter how hard you try as a parent.  In those newborn days, there will be times you sit up at 3am frustrated, crying, and wondering what else you can do, and contemplating ways to escape.  Don’t worry about it, and don’t think you are a bad parent… it happens to all of us. Although most of us aren’t as willing to share our negative thoughts, or experiences.  And sometimes it only gets worse with age!

7. No matter how much you spend on cream to prevent stretch marks… if you are genetically going to get them, there is nothing that $75 oil made from the pee of a tiger is going to do. And there is no magic cream that will get rid of them after your child is born either. I was lucky enough not to get one stretch mark with my oldest, and by 20 weeks with my second, I was covered. Eh… they are just battle wounds that come with parenting, because they are only going to continue as your children get older.   They can go along with the unpainted finger nails and bags under your eyes.

8. Make Dad be involved… In pregnancy, childbirth, diapers, you name it… he should be there right along side of you doing it too. No excuses!

9. Over 40% of labor inductions end in c-sections… Yes, that is a huge number… It happened to me with my first, and had I known the odds of a c-section, and that they were really THAT high… I would have never gone in for the induction.

10. Never take advice from internet due date forums. This is something new I have been watching, especially after my childbirth education training over the summer. So many women give out horridly bad, and outdated advice and first time mothers take it as some kind of gospel.
