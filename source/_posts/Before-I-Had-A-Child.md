You won't sleep
Babies are humans with emotions like you
Use family and friends for questions
"Mommy Brain" you will forget things
Trust yourself and your instincts...
You will make mistakes
Don't compare your child to anyone
There is an end in sight with every stage of child rearing
Don't be a control freak

listen to your children
You will become a human napkin
They grow up fast
The laundry never ends
You will feel everything your child is going through

Let children be themselves
Your children will love you unconditionally
Interview providers. Don't just blindly pick a hospital.
Watch the business of being born
Take a childbirth education class
Read books about pregnancy but skip books that are going to scare you or try and make fun of pregnancy

Breastfeeding is hard
Feeding your child is a chore

Your children will not be perfect
You won't get rid of stretch marks
Make dad be involved
Over 40% of labor inductions end in c-sections
Never take advice from internet due date forums

Happy mommy makes for a happy baby
Don't feel bad about feeling good about leaving the child
Take time for yourself
